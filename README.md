DATA SCIENCE GETTING AND CLEANING DATA COURSE PROJECT (WEEK 4)

This document describes my project for the completion of the Course Project of Week 4 of the Johns Hopkins U Data Science Specialization (Course 3, Getting and Cleaning Data).

The project contains:
* an .R file named "run_analysis.R" executing the steps required in the project description
* a CodeBook describing the variables used in "run_analysis.R"
* This README.txt file
* The source of the original data and a broad description of how it was retrieved is appended at the end of the README file (Section "ORIGINAL DATA SOURCE".

1) Aim of the project

The aim of this project is to retrieve, clean, manipulate and export data based on an experiment on Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones.

2) The "run_analysis.R" file

The "run_analysis.R" is broken down to 5 sections, each corresponding to the steps in the project description.

Section 1 downloads the original data from "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip", unzips it and reads the different .txt files into the workspace. After assigning the appropriate column names, it first binds the train data and the test data each columnwise, then the two data sets (test and train) rowwise. The resulting object "mergedDataSet" is a dataframe.

Section 2 creates a new dataframe extracting only those columns including "mean" or "std" anywhere in the column name, plus the variables "activity" and "GroupCode". The variable GroupCode in my code denotes the participant-ID.

Section 3 replaces the numeric encoding of the activity variable by its character names as described in "activity_labels.txt".

Section 4 performes some readability-enhancing replacements on the variable labels based on the information provided in "features_info.txt".

Section 5 computes the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

3) The CodeBook

The CodeBook provides additional details on the variables.

==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
